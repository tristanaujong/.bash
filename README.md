I made a copy of my bashrc to make sure if any of this breaks, I have access to the og file

I split my bashrc into separate bash files to organize it better. default contains the code that came w bash, alias is to reference other commands in an easier fashion, and exports is different
apps I install

the echo command displays the files i have, also used as an indicator that my bash is working

i then made a git repository so that in case anything breaks in the future, i have access to a working version
